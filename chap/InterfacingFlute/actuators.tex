This long term measurement yields a standard deviation of

\subsection{Actual stability - short term}
Again because of the lower bandwidth of the multimeter compared with an oscilloscope (compare \autoref{sec:atteneval-VcStabST}), the short term stability is evaluated with an oscilloscope measurement (see \autoref{fig:atteneval-vsuppstab-shorttermTime} and \autoref{fig:atteneval-vsuppstab-shorttermSpec}).

The oscilloscope measurement shows a much higher standard deviation than the multimeter measurement of
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{V,+,shortterm} = \SI{50}{\milli\volt}
\end{equation}

\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Conclusion}
The short term noise with $\sigma_{V,+,shortterm} = \SI{50}{\milli\volt}$ is fairly high compared to the other DAC channel (with a higher output voltage). But these variations are not visible on the multimeter due to the lower bandwidth ($\sigma_{V,+,longterm} = \SI{0.154}{\milli\volt}$). This suggests the power supply can simply be stabilized with a RC lowpass or just a capacitor at the devices supply voltage input.

But even without compensation the effects of the high frequency noise could not be seen in the attenuation, so device naturally rejects high frequency noise on its supply input.

\section{Stability requirements of the case temperature $\theta_{case}$}
\subsection{Required stability}
To asses acceptable temperature change, first the influence of the device temperature of the attenuation is measured. For that the bottom of the device is fixed to a rectangular iron profile with zip ties. The iron profile is heated with the tip of a soldering iron (set to \SI{150}{\degreeCelsius}) for \SI{1}{\minute} and then allowed to cool for \SI{20}{\minute}. This cycle is repeated three times and the device temperature and the attenuation are measured once every \SI{2}{\second}. Due to the dynamic flow of heat from the soldering iron to the iron profile and through device itself, a strong hysteresis is visible in the curve in \autoref{fig:atteneval-tempstab-influence}. 

To linearly approximate the temperature influence, the single measurements are binned together for similar temperature values (rounded to two decimal places). Then a mean operation is applied over the binned values (see \autoref{fig:atteneval-tempstab-influenceMean}).

\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=0.5\textwidth]{chap/5-own-work-actuators/img/atteneval/TempStab/influenceTemp.tikz}
	\caption{Attenuation over case temperature; color scale shows time progress of the total measurement}

\end{figure}

	\caption{Attenuation over case temperature}
	\label{fig:atteneval-tempstab-influenceMean}
\end{figure}

From that the slope of the curve is taken at $\vartheta_{case,0}=\SI{23}{\degreeCelsius}$\footnote{This is not necessarily room temperature or expected operating temperature of the device but a convenient choice to get a linear curve section.}.

With a slope of $\left.\frac{\text{d}A(\vartheta_{case})}{\text{d}\vartheta_{case}}\right|_{0} = \SI{0.0075}{\dB\per\kelvin}$, the influence on attenuation becomes
\begin{align}
\Delta A(\vartheta_{case}) &= \left.\frac{\text{d}A(V_{control})}{\text{d}V_{control}}\right|_{o} \cdot \Delta T_{case} \\
\Delta A(\vartheta_{case}) &= \SI{0.0075}{\dB\per\kelvin} \cdot \Delta V+
\end{align}

which means the allowed deviation of $\vartheta_{case}$ from $\vartheta_{case,0}$ becomes
\begin{align}\label{eq:atteneval-stabTemp}
\left|\Delta \vartheta_{case}\right| &= \left|\Delta A(\vartheta_{case})\right| \cdot 
\left|\left[\left.\frac{\text{d}A(\vartheta_{case})}{\text{d}\vartheta_{case}}\right|_{0}\right]^{-1}\right| \\
 &= \SI{0.005}{\dB} \cdot \SI{133.33}{\kelvin\per\dB} = \SI{0.666}{\kelvin}
\end{align}

This would even be hard to achieve in climatized office spaces (like the IBPT RF lab), since aird conditioners can only keep the room temperature stable to about \SI{2}{\degreeCelsius} (depending on the distance to the air outlet, other heat sources in the room, open windows, etc.).

\subsection{Conclusion}
The results in \autoref{fig:atteneval-tempstab-influenceMean} and \autoref{eq:atteneval-stabTemp} suggest two solutions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Either mount the device in a temperature controlled cabinet to keep the temperature constant.
\item Or since the plot in \autoref{fig:atteneval-tempstab-influenceMean} shows the slope becoming more flat towards higher temperatures, it could may be possible to operate the device on purpose at higher case temperatures (According to the data sheet\cite{mini-circuitsZX732500VoltageVariable}, the maximum operating temperature is \SI{85}{\degreeCelsius}).
\end{itemize}

\section{$V_{control}$ Frequency response}
Using a non inverting adder with a \textit{TS912IN} operational amplifier, a sine wave with constant offset is made, which is then used to drive the control voltage $V_{control}$. The result for different sine wave frequencies is shown in \autoref{fig:atteneval-freqresp}.

\section{Influence of RF frequency variations}
In this section the influence of a varying RF frequency on attenuation is examined. For that the set frequency of the R\&S SMC100 signal generator is varied while the attenuation is measured with the HP E4419B RF power meter. The result is shown in \autoref{fig:atteneval-rf}.

\section{Testing the Attenuator in the RF cabinet at FLUTE}
Without FLUTE being switched on, the attenuator is left in the RF cabinet in the bunker basement. Over the course of \SI{100}{\hour}, the case temperature is taken every two seconds and the deviation from the mean temperature \SI{25.4}{\degreeCelsius} is computed (see \autoref{fig:atteneval-tempInCabinet}). The figure also shows a power spectrum (calculated using Welch's method with a hanning window) of the temperature deviation.

With a standard deviation of \SI{0.05522}{\kelvin}, a maximum positive swing of \SI{0.18}{\kelvin} and a maximum negative swing of \SI{0.17}{\kelvin} (a span of \SI{0.3559}{\kelvin}), the temperature stability is well inside the \SI{0.6}{\kelvin} tolerance.
