From that the slope of the curve is taken at $\vartheta_{case,0}=\SI{23}{\degreeCelsius}$\footnote{This is not necessarily room temperature or expected operating temperature of the device but a convenient choice to get a linear curve section.}.

With a slope of $\left.\frac{\text{d}A(\vartheta_{case})}{\text{d}\vartheta_{case}}\right|_{0} = \SI{0.0075}{\dB\per\kelvin}$, the influence on attenuation becomes
\begin{align}
\Delta A(\vartheta_{case}) &= \left.\frac{\text{d}A(V_{control})}{\text{d}V_{control}}\right|_{o} \cdot \Delta T_{case} \\
\Delta A(\vartheta_{case}) &= \SI{0.0075}{\dB\per\kelvin} \cdot \Delta V+
\end{align}

which means the allowed deviation of $\vartheta_{case}$ from $\vartheta_{case,0}$ becomes
\begin{align}\label{eq:atteneval-stabTemp}
\left|\Delta \vartheta_{case}\right| &= \left|\Delta A(\vartheta_{case})\right| \cdot 
\left|\left[\left.\frac{\text{d}A(\vartheta_{case})}{\text{d}\vartheta_{case}}\right|_{0}\right]^{-1}\right| \\
 &= \SI{0.005}{\dB} \cdot \SI{133.33}{\kelvin\per\dB} = \SI{0.666}{\kelvin}
\end{align}

This would even be hard to achieve in climatized office spaces (like the IBPT RF lab), since aird conditioners can only keep the room temperature stable to about \SI{2}{\degreeCelsius} (depending on the distance to the air outlet, other heat sources in the room, open windows, etc.).

\subsection{Conclusion}
The results in \autoref{fig:atteneval-tempstab-influenceMean} and \autoref{eq:atteneval-stabTemp} suggest two solutions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Either mount the device in a temperature controlled cabinet to keep the temperature constant.
\item Or since the plot in \autoref{fig:atteneval-tempstab-influenceMean} shows the slope becoming more flat towards higher temperatures, it could may be possible to operate the device on purpose at higher case temperatures (According to the data sheet\cite{mini-circuitsZX732500VoltageVariable}, the maximum operating temperature is \SI{85}{\degreeCelsius}).
\end{itemize}
