\subsection{Estimating the Spectrum of a Stochastic Process}
For a deterministic signal $x(t) \in \mathcal{L}_1$, the Fourier transform exists\cite{Lapidoth2019} and is defined as
\begin{equation}
\hat{x}(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x(t)\,\text{e}^{-j 2 \pi f t}\,\text{d}t.
\end{equation}
As $\hat{x}(f)$ is in general complex valued, it is often convenient to split it into $\left|\hat{x}(f)\right|$, called the magnitude and $\angle\{\hat{x}(f)\}$, called the phase.

It is also common to refer to
\begin{equation}
10\cdot\log\left(\left|\hat{x}(f)\right|^2\right)
\end{equation}
as the energy density spectrum, expressed in the pseudo unit ``decibel'' (dB).
