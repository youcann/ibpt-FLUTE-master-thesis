\chapter*{Acknowledgments}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

First i would like to thank Prof. Anke-Susanne Müller and the whole FLUTE team for providing me with the opportunity to write my thesis at their research facility. FLUTE proved to be a one-of-a-kind machine and i really appreciate the work that has been put into it.

Many thanks go also to Prof. Dr.-Ing. John Jelonnek from the institute for pulsed power and microwave technology for taking the responsibility of being my first reviewer. Also many thanks to his PhD students Benjamin Ell and Alexander Marek for being very patient while listening to and optimizing my presentations. 

I'm especially in debt to my excellent advisor Dr. Nigel John Smale, for always having the time to go over both fundamentals and nifty details of electronics and physics alike. Without his support i wouldn't even be able to switch on FLUTE by now and much less a sucessful thesis would've been possible.

Thanks to Igor Križnar for constructive discussions and programming the GUI panel to control the charge sensitive amplifier.

Thanks Olena Manzhura for her support and for prove-reading the thesis multiple times.

And lastly but maybe most importantly, a big thanks goes out to my family, that is my mom Sonja, Stefan and my grand-parents Ernst and Gretel, for supporting me during my whole course of studies.
